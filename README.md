# The Augment

A Slay the Spire mod that adds a new character -- The Augment, a veteran wizard who uses Focus both for a limited selection of orbs and for Magic attacks.  They also interact with card rewards and their own deck in unique ways.

# TODO

## Next up

* Switch Adventitious, Spontaneous, and Magic to use @SpirePatch
* Draw up alpha art

## Implement

* All art
* Most cards
* Most relics
* Concentration keyword
* Rework Magic to work like Spontaneous and Adventitious

## Balance
* Nerf Stunning Strike (and possibly buff Magic Weapon)
* Starstorm should end your turn (though not for balance reasons)
* Knowledge is Power shouldn't trigger on draw-for-turn
* Consider making Steelwind Strike magic
* Consider changing timing of passive effect of Aether orbs
